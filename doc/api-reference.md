# API Reference

## Swagger UI
Once you deploy the service, you will be able to navigate to the API Reference (Swagger definition)
of your newly created service by going to **https://<service_name>.azurewebsites.net/swagger** . You will get the root url
upon deploying your service.

The swagger UI is the authoritative definition of the API interface -- but we have duplicated a
description of the API reference here so you can understand what the service will look like before
you actually deploy it.

## Authentication
When calling the service, you will need to set authentication headers with the API key that is provided as part of the set-up process.

If you did not copy the keys at the time of setting up the preconfigured solution, you can find those by:
1. Logging into the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/)
2. Navigating to the resource group that was created by the solution. The resource group is named after the deployment name you provided when you set up the solution.
3. Then navigate to **App Service**.
4. Click on **Application Settings**
5. The keys are under the **App settings** section, they are called *AdminPrimaryKey*, *AdminSecondaryKey*, *RecommendPrimaryKey* and *RecommendSecondaryKey*.

The primary and secondary *Admin* keys can be used for all API operations while the primary and secondary *Recommend* keys can only be used to 
get recommendations, typically used in client applications or websites requesting recommendations.

Sample authentication header:

```
x-api-key: <yourKeyGoesHere>
```

## Train a New Model
*POST /api/models*

Starts the process of training a new model that could be later used to query for
recommendations. To start training a model one must first upload usage data, and optionally a catalog and evaluation files,
to the new blob storage account created by the preconfigured solution.

Training a new model is an asynchronous operation. The response to this HTTP request contains a *Location* header that 
reference the newly created model, as well as the model in the body of the response.
You can use the [Get Model API](#get-model-information) to query for the model training status along with other model information.
 
Optionally model metrics are computed if *evaluationUsageFolderRelativeLocation* is provided. See [Model Evaluation](model-evaluation.md) for more details.

The **request** body should be a valid [Model Training Parameters](#model-training-parameters-schema) JSON object.

The **response** body will contain a [Model](#model-object-schema) JSON object.

### Catalog File Schema
The catalog file contains information about the items you are offering to your customer.
The catalog data should follow the following format:

* Without features - `<Item Id>,<Item Name>,<Item Category>[,<Description>]`
* With features - `<Item Id>,<Item Name>,<Item Category>,[<Description>],<Features list>`

#### Sample Rows in a Catalog File
Without features:

    AAA04294,Office Language Pack Online DwnLd,Office
    AAA04303,Minecraft Download Game,Games
    C9F00168,Kiruna Flip Cover,Accessories

With features:

    AAA04294,Office Language Pack Online DwnLd,Office,, softwaretype=productivity, compatibility=Windows
    BAB04303,Minecraft DwnLd,Games, softwaretype=gaming,, compatibility=iOS, agegroup=all
    C9F00168,Kiruna Flip Cover,Accessories, compatibility=lumia,, hardwaretype=mobile

#### Schema details
| Name | Mandatory | Type | Description |
|:--- |:--- |:--- |:--- |
| Item Id |Yes | [A-z], [a-z], [0-9], [_] &#40;Underscore&#41;, [-] &#40;Dash&#41;<br/> Max length: 450 |Unique identifier of an item. |
| Item Name |Yes |Any alphanumeric characters<br/> Max length: 255 |Item name. |
| Item Category |Yes |Any alphanumeric characters <br/> Max length: 255 |Category to which this item belongs (e.g. Cooking Books, Drama…); can be empty. |
| Description |No, unless features are present (but can be empty) |Any alphanumeric characters <br/> Max length: 4000 |Description of this item. |
| Features list |No |Any alphanumeric characters <br/> Max length: 4000; Max number of features:20 |Comma-separated list of feature name=feature value that can be used to enhance model recommendation. |


#### Why add features to the catalog?
The recommendations engine creates a statistical model that tells you what items are likely to be liked or purchased by a customer. When you have a new product that has never been interacted with it is not possible to create a model on co-occurrences alone. Let's say you start offering a new "children's violin" in your store, since you have never sold that violin before you cannot tell what other items to recommend with that violin.

That said, if the engine knows information about that violin (i.e. It's a musical instrument, it is for children ages 7-10, it is not an expensive violin, etc.), then the engine can learn from other products with similar features. For instance, you have sold violin's in the past and usually people that buy violins tend to buy classical music CDs and sheet music stands.  The system can find these connections between the features and provide recommendations based on the features while your new violin has little usage.

Features are imported as part of the catalog data. The SAR algorithm that is used to train the model will automatically detect the strength of each of the features based on the transaction data.

#### Features are Categorical
You should create features that resemble a category. For instance, price=9.34 is not a categorical feature. On the other hand, a feature like priceRange=Under5Dollars is a categorical feature. Another common mistake is to use the name of the item as a feature. This would cause the name of an item to be unique so it would not describe a category. Make sure the features represent categories of items.

#### How many/which features should I use?
You should use less than 20 features.

#### When are features actually used?
Features are used by the model when there is not enough transaction data to provide recommendations on transaction information alone. So features will have the greatest impact on “cold items” – items with few transactions. If all your items have sufficient transaction information you may not need to enrich your model with features.

### Usage Data
A usage file contains information about how those items are used, or the transactions from your business.

#### Usage Events File Schema
A usage file is a CSV (comma separated value) file where each row in a usage file represents an interaction between a user and an item. Each row is formatted as follows:<br/>
`<User Id>,<Item Id>,<Time>[,<Event Type> | ,,<Custom Event Weight>]`

| Name | Mandatory | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| User Id |Yes |[A-z], [a-z], [0-9], [_] &#40;Underscore&#41;, [-] &#40;Dash&#41;<br/> Max length: 255 |Unique identifier of a user. |
| Item Id |Yes |[A-z], [a-z], [0-9], [&#95;] &#40;Underscore&#41;, [-] &#40;Dash&#41;<br/> Max length: 450 |Unique identifier of an item. |
| Time |Yes |Date in ISO 8601 format:<br/>**yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss**<br/>(e.g. 2017-04-20T18:00:00) |The time of the event |
| Event Type<br/><br/><br/>*only used in [model evaluation](#model-evaluation.md) |No |One of the following:<br/> **Click** (=weight of 1)<br/>**RecommendationClick** (=weight of 2)<br/>**AddShopCart** (=weight of 3)<br/>**RemoveShopCart** (=weight of -1)<br/>**Purchase** (=weight of 4)<br/> (defaults to **Click**)|The type of transaction. <br/>This will be used to determain the event strength. <br/><br/> *used only if *Custom Event Weight* is not provided. | 
| Custom Event Weight <br/><br/>*only used in [model evaluation](#model-evaluation.md)|No |number | The trasaction strength.<br/><br/>*if provided, *Evnet Type* will be ignored. |

## Model Evaluation Metrics Schema

The following table specifies the schema of the *model evaluation metrics* JSON object:

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|---------------|------|-------------|
| precisionMetrics | Array of [Precision Metric](#precision-metric-schema) objects | Precision@K metrics for a model. These are a measure of quality of the Model. It works by splitting the input data into a test and training data. Then use the test period to evaluate what percentage of the customers would have actually clicked on a recommendation if k recommendations had been shown to them given their prior history.
| diversityMetrics | [Model Diversity Metrics](#model-diversity-metrics-schema) | The model diversity metrics. Diversity gives customers a sense of how diverse the item recommendations are, based on their usage shown by bucket eg: 0-90, 90-99, 99-100. In simple terms, how many recommendations are coming from most popular items, how many from non-popular etc., unique items recommended.
